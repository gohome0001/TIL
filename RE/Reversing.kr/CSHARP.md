# CSHARP

I've never had a chance to read CIL(Common Intermediate Language) in raw.

It would be good to hand-ray those, but I used a tool name `.Net Reflector`

But the Method was Packed.. so I had to Debug it.

I just used VS, and read the unpacked data, and modified the .exe file

When I hand it off to the disassembler, all I had to do is analyse the xor keygen.

It was a simple thing to do, and I just did that.

the input was converted into base64 format, so I just decoded the generated comparing key.

Done!

(I thought I was solving CSHOP, but I was solving other binary..)
